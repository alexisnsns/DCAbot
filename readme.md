DeFi Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) tool

Automatically withdraw + swap USDC from a Fluid/Morpho vault into multiple tokens with a custom ratio (e.g., 60% rETH, 40% AAVE) using Paraswap API.

Automatic allowance check & approval

Per-token slippage & price impact protection

Logs swaps & confirmations

I use it to DCA automatically, keeping my USDC earning yield instead of sitting idle.
